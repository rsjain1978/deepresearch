description: This rule file shows we should invoke OpenAI API for any text generation or reasoning activity using AI
globs: 
---
For text prompts use type of API call: You will use only this type of API call:

from openai import AsyncOpenAI
client = AsyncOpenAI()

completion = client.chat.completions.create(
    model="gpt-4o",
    messages=[
        {"role": "system", "content": "You are a helpful assistant."},
        {
            "role": "user",
            "content": "Write a haiku about recursion in programming."
        }
    ]
)

4. gpt-4o is a valid model name, do not use gpt-4

use json mode for openai api calls. response_format={"type": "json_object"}

print(completion.choices[0].message)

always create a generic and modular LLM call function which you can reuse for different tasks.
