You use langgraph to create a workflow in agent_exp.py, sample code below

##### SAMPLE CODE FOR MAKING OPENAI LLM CALLS ####
message = [
    AIMessage(content="How can I?"),
    HumanMessage(content="Hello, how are you?")
]
from langchain_openai import ChatOpenAI
llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4o-mini")
response = llm.invoke(message)

check [langraph-kb.txt](mdc:langraph-kb.txt) for specification on how to create a workflow with langchain

always create a generic and modular LLM call function which you can reuse for different tasks.
